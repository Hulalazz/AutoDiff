AutoDiff PoC
=============

Need to be changed
------------------
In file SignificantFunctions.py change line :
TMP_SIGS = r"PATH\functions.txt"
it should be changed to absolute path to functions.txt file.

Batch mode example of usage:
idaq.exe -A -S"AutoDiff.py -f 1 -b \"gdi32_primary_vs_gdi32_secondary.BinDiff\" -d \"X:\GDI\old\gdi32.idb\" -a" X:\GDI\patched\gdi32.idb
